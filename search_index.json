Motivation","body":"Motivation\nWithin React applications, I frequently want to share and update some state without having to pass it down the whole component tree.\nUsually you would go with something like Redux or MobX, but I dislike the idea to use those for small things like showing/hiding a modal. In general, I prefer using those only for business logic.\nWith React&#39;s new Context API, we get an encapsulated way to share state throughout the whole child component tree without having to pass it down and since React 16.3 it even ships a lightweight render-props based component API instead of using the old declarative API.\n"},"docs/introduction/How.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/How.html","title":"1.2. How It Works","body":"How It Works\nAlveron is entirely built on React&#39;s build-in Context API.\nCreating a new store instance using createStore will use React&#39;s createContext to create a local context store returning two components: Provider and Consumer.\nAlveron wraps those components in order to automatically bind the model, actions and effects to its local React state.\nIllustration\n\nTo be done.\n\n"},"docs/introduction/Caveats.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/Caveats.html","title":"1.3. Caveats","body":"Caveats\n1. Unique Store Instances\ncreateStore doesn&#39;t actually create a store directly, but rather create a factory by providing the Provider component.\nEvery Provider component therefore manages its own state object, that is derived from the store model and the passed initialState.\nThus, having multiple Provider will lead to multiple store instances that both have separate state. The Consumer component will always interact with the closest wrapping Provider.\nIn order to have a single global store instance, wrap your root component with the Provider component and use the Consumer whereever you&#39;d like to access that global store.\n"},"docs/introduction/Comparison.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/Comparison.html","title":"1.4.

Therefore it shares a lot of concepts and ideas.\nCompared to Alveron, it has a bit more complicated API as it ships way more explicit props. With Alveron you only set the model, actions and effects and handle all the rendering logic and lifecycle methods yourself.\nWith Constate on the other hand, you e.g. have APIs to directly handle state changes on component (un)mount and update. It also ships selectors out-of-the-box while with Alveron you&#39;d have to add that yourself.\nIn contrast to Constate, Alveron is always distinct. Equivocality can occur when multiple Container share the same context, but set different initialState values. In this case, Constate will only consider the initialState of the first Container.\nSummary\nAlveron is less opinionated and more focused on the state management only while Constate gives you way more APIs to handle all kind of use cases ou-of-the-box.\n"},"docs/introduction/Ecosystem.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/Ecosystem.html","title":"1.5.

The server must first receive the call, process it and send an answer over the network which unfortunately takes some time.\nYet we learned, that actions shouldn&apos;t cause side effects and be predictable in their output. That&apos;s where effects fill the gap. When an effect is called, it e.g. sends the API requests, waits for the answer, and then calls an action with the received data once.\n"},"docs/concepts/Middleware.html":{"url":"docs/concepts/Middleware.html","title":"2.4.

Performance","body":"Performance\nBy default, every Consumer component in a given Provider scope will update if its state changes.\nThat means, only the affected Consumer actually update, which is a neat advantage over e.g. Redux.\nYet, we still don&apos;t need to update every Consumer all the time e.g. if we only consume parts of the state. To achieve that, we can implement shouldComponentUpdate within our consuming React components.\n\nNote: In general, there&apos;s no need for such low level optimisations, but sometimes it might help to improve performance e.g. for big lists.\n\nExample\nConsider the following example where a generic Input component uses the store to select the correct key.\nimport React from &apos;react&apos;\nimport { createStore } from &apos;react-woodworm&apos;\n\nconst model = {\n  firstname: &apos;&apos;,\n  lastname: &apos;&apos;\n}\n\nconst actions = {\n  update: (state, change) =&gt; ({\n    ...state,\n    ...change\n  })\n}\n\nconst User = createStore({\n  model,\n  actions\n})\n\nconst Input = ({ field }) =&gt; (\n  &lt;User.Consumer&gt;\n    ({ state, actions }) =&gt; (\n      &lt;input value={state[field]} onChange={e =&gt; actions.update({\n        [field]: e.target.value\n      })} /&gt;\n    )\n  &lt;/User.Consumer&gt;\n)\n\n\nconst UserInfo = () =&gt; (\n  &lt;User.Provider&gt;\n    &lt;Input field=&quot;firstname&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;Input field=&quot;lastname&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/User.Provider&gt;\n)\n\nWhenever we type in one of the input fields, both Input components are updated and will rerender. It&apos;s not a huge deal as React doesn&apos;t actuallly trigger DOM updates if the render output doesn&apos;t change, but still the render method could be expensive.\nLet&apos;s rebuild the same example but using shouldComponentUpdate this time.\n\nWe left out the first lines as they won&apos;t change anyways.\n\nclass PureInput extends Component {\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {\n    const { field, state } = this.props\n\n    // we only update if the field value changes\n    return (\n      state[field] !== nextProps.state[field]\n    )\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { state, actions } = this.props\n\n    const value = state[field]\n    const onChange = e =&gt; actions.update({\n      [field]: e.target.value\n    })\n\n    return (\n      &lt;input value={value} onChange={onChange} /&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst Input = ({ field }) =&gt; (\n  &lt;User.Consumer&gt;\n    {({ state, actions }) =&gt; (\n      &lt;PureInput field={field} state={state} actions={actions} /&gt;\n    )}\n  &lt;/User.Consumer&gt;\n)\n\n\nconst UserInfo = () =&gt; (\n  &lt;User.Provider&gt;\n    &lt;Input field=&quot;firstname&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;Input field=&quot;lastname&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/User.Provider&gt;\n)\n\nNow we will only rerender the input component that is actually updated.\n\nRelated\n\nReact - API Reference: shouldComponentUpdate\nReact - Advanced Guides: Optimizing Performance\n\nTools\nshallow-equalMinimalistic shallow equality check for arrays/objects\n"},"docs/API.html":{"url":"docs/API.html","title":"4.
