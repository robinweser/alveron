In general, I prefer using those only for business logic.\nWith React&#39;s new Context API, we get an encapsulated way to share state throughout the whole child component tree without having to pass it down and since React 16.3 it even ships a lightweight render-props based component API instead of using the old declarative API.\n"},"docs/introduction/How.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/How.html","title":"1.2. How It Works","body":"How It Works\nAlveron is entirely built on React&#39;s build-in Context API.\nCreating a new store instance using createStore will use React&#39;s createContext to create a local context store returning two components: Provider and Consumer.\nAlveron wraps those components in order to automatically bind the model, actions and effects to its local React state.\nIllustration\n\nTo be done.\n\n"},"docs/introduction/Design.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/Design.html","title":"1.3. Design Principles","body":"Design Principles\nState is read-only\n\nThis principle is inspired by Redux and is basically a rewritten copy of their documentation. \n\nThe only way to change the state is by calling actions.\nA action is a function that reduces the previous state and a payload to the next state.\nThis ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state. Instead, they use predefined actions to ensure predictable state changes. \nActions are pure functions\nAs mentioned above, in order to update the state, actions are called with an optional payload.\nThose actions follow the reducer-pattern as they reduce the current state and the payload to the next state. While we can&#39;t enforce pure reducers, it&#39;s highly recommended and for your own good.\nCheck the actions documentation to learn what a pure function is.\nEffects must call actions to update the state\nPerforming side effects, such as API calls, can be done using effects. They can neither access the state nor update the state directly, but they can call actions at any time.\nThat&#39;s a fundamental decision in order to keep side effects as simple and stupid as possible.

Unique Store Instances\ncreateStore doesn&#39;t actually create a store directly, but rather create a factory by providing the Provider component.\nEvery Provider component therefore manages its own state object, that is derived from the store model and the passed initialState.\nThus, having multiple Provider will lead to multiple store instances that both have separate state. The Consumer component will always interact with the closest wrapping Provider.\nIn order to have a single global store instance, wrap your root component with the Provider component and use the Consumer whereever you&#39;d like to access that global store.\n"},"docs/introduction/Comparison.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/Comparison.html","title":"1.5.

Therefore it shares a lot of concepts and ideas.\nCompared to Alveron, it has a bit more complicated API as it ships way more explicit props. With Alveron you only set the model, actions and effects and handle all the rendering logic and lifecycle methods yourself.\nWith Constate on the other hand, you e.g. have APIs to directly handle state changes on component (un)mount and update. It also ships selectors out-of-the-box while with Alveron you&#39;d have to add that yourself.\nIn contrast to Constate, Alveron is always distinct. Equivocality can occur when multiple Container share the same context, but set different initialState values. In this case, Constate will only consider the initialState of the first Container.\nSummary\nAlveron is less opinionated and more focused on the state management only while Constate gives you way more APIs to handle all kind of use cases ou-of-the-box.\n"},"docs/introduction/Ecosystem.html":{"url":"docs/introduction/Ecosystem.html","title":"1.6.

To achieve that, we can implement shouldComponentUpdate within our consuming React components.\n\nNote: In general, there&apos;s no need for such low level optimisations, but sometimes it might help to improve performance e.g. for big lists.\n\nExample\nConsider the following example where a generic Input component uses the store to select the correct key.\nimport React from &apos;react&apos;\nimport { createStore } from &apos;react-woodworm&apos;\n\nconst model = {\n  firstname: &apos;&apos;,\n  lastname: &apos;&apos;\n}\n\nconst actions = {\n  update: (state, change) =&gt; ({\n    ...state,\n    ...change\n  })\n}\n\nconst User = createStore({\n  model,\n  actions\n})\n\nconst Input = ({ field }) =&gt; (\n  &lt;User.Consumer&gt;\n    ({ state, actions }) =&gt; (\n      &lt;input value={state[field]} onChange={e =&gt; actions.update({\n        [field]: e.target.value\n      })} /&gt;\n    )\n  &lt;/User.Consumer&gt;\n)\n\n\nconst UserInfo = () =&gt; (\n  &lt;User.Provider&gt;\n    &lt;Input field=&quot;firstname&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;Input field=&quot;lastname&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/User.Provider&gt;\n)\n\nWhenever we type in one of the input fields, both Input components are updated and will rerender. It&apos;s not a huge deal as React doesn&apos;t actuallly trigger DOM updates if the render output doesn&apos;t change, but still the render method could be expensive.\nLet&apos;s rebuild the same example but using shouldComponentUpdate this time.\n\nWe left out the first lines as they won&apos;t change anyways.\n\nclass PureInput extends Component {\n  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {\n    const { field, state } = this.props\n\n    // we only update if the field value changes\n    return (\n      state[field] !== nextProps.state[field]\n    )\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    const { state, actions } = this.props\n\n    const value = state[field]\n    const onChange = e =&gt; actions.update({\n      [field]: e.target.value\n    })\n\n    return (\n      &lt;input value={value} onChange={onChange} /&gt;\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst Input = ({ field }) =&gt; (\n  &lt;User.Consumer&gt;\n    {({ state, actions }) =&gt; (\n      &lt;PureInput field={field} state={state} actions={actions} /&gt;\n    )}\n  &lt;/User.Consumer&gt;\n)\n\n\nconst UserInfo = () =&gt; (\n  &lt;User.Provider&gt;\n    &lt;Input field=&quot;firstname&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;Input field=&quot;lastname&quot; /&gt;\n  &lt;/User.Provider&gt;\n)\n\nNow we will only rerender the input component that is actually updated.\nBatch Updates\ntbd.\n\nRelated\n\nReact - API Reference: shouldComponentUpdate\nReact - Advanced Guides: Optimizing Performance\n\nTools\nshallow-equalMinimalistic shallow equality check for arrays/objects\n"},"docs/advanced/LifecycleMethods.html":{"url":"docs/advanced/LifecycleMethods.html","title":"3.2.

Note that hooks are still experimental and subject to change.\n\nSince version 3.0.0, Alveron also provides the useAlveron hook which provides the similar functionality compared to createStore which uses the render-props pattern.Thanks to the useEffect hook, using Alveron effects could not be any simpler. We don&apos;t have to wrap our component with a class component just to call an effect e.g. when mounting.\nBasic Usage\nThe basic usage example is probably the Counter component which is also used in the examples and throughout the documentation. Here&apos;s how that&apos;d be implemented using hooks.\nimport { useAlveron } from &apos;alveron&apos;\n\nconst store = {\n  model: 0,\n  actions: {\n    increment: state =&gt; state + 1,\n    decrement: state =&gt; state - 1\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const { state, actions } = useAlveron(store)\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;{state}&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={actions.increment}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;button onClick={actions.decrement}&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\n\nEffects\nNow let&apos;s see how we can use effects together with the useEffect hook. A simple example would be fetching some data. We want to show a loading spinner as long as it runs and immediately trigger the effect on mounting.\nWe&apos;re going to use the JSON Placerholder REST API to fetch a mocked todo item.\nimport { useEffect } from &apos;react&apos;\nimport { useAlveron } from &apos;alveron&apos;\n\nconst store = {\n  model: {\n    data: undefined,\n    error: undefined,\n    loading: false\n  },\n  actions: {\n    setLoading = (state, loading) =&gt; ({\n      ...state,\n      loading\n    }),\n    setError = (state, error) =&gt; ({\n      ...state,\n      error\n    }),\n    setData = (state, data) =&gt; ({\n      ...state,\n      data\n    })\n  },\n  effects: {\n    fetchData: actions =&gt; {\n      // make sure the loading spinner shows up\n      actions.setLoading(true)\n\n      fetch(&apos;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1&apos;)\n        .then(res =&gt; res.json())\n        .then(json =&gt; {\n          if (!json) {\n            actions.setError(/* some error */)\n          }\n\n          actions.setData(json)\n        })\n        .catch(actions.setError)\n        // make sure the loading is set to false whatever happens above\n        .finally(() =&gt; actions.setLoading(false))\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const { state, actions, effects } = useAlveron(store)\n\n  // using the empty array to only fetch once when mounting\n  useEffect(effects.fetchData, [])\n\n  const { loading, error, data } = state \n\n  if (loading) return &lt;div&gt;LOADING&lt;/div&gt;\n  if (error) return &lt;div&gt;ERROR&lt;/div&gt;\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      {JSON.stringify(data)}\n      &lt;button onClick={effects.fetchData}&gt;Refetch&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}\n\nGlobal State\ntbd.\n"},"docs/API.html":{"url":"docs/API.html","title":"4.
