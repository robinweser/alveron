# Effect

Apart from pure state updates, Alveron also supports side effects out of the box.
Effects can only be triggered by invoking an action.
They are passed as the second item in the array returned from actions.

```
type Effect = (actions: Object) => void
```

Asynchronous behaviour is very common in software, but deailing with it oftentimes is very painful.
Unpredictable side effects are one of the main sources for errors in modern software. They are oftentimes very hard to debug and sometimes even hard to reproduce.
But it doesn't have to be like that! In order to prevent that, effects in Alveron are very limited making it much safer without loosing the flexibility:
Effects do not update the state directly, but rather invoke actions themselves, bringing back the predictable nature of synchronous actions.

## Example

The following example shows a basic API call scenario where we fetch some data with a loading spinner and eventually get either data or an error back.

```js
const model = {
  loading: false,
  error: null,
  data: null,
}

const effect = async (onSuccess, onFailure) => {
  const res = await fetch('...')

  if (res.status === 200) {
    const data = await res.json()
    onSuccess(data)
  } else {
    onFailure(res.error)
  }
}

const actions = {
  setSuccess: (prevState, data) => [{ loading: false, error: null, data }],
  setError: (prevState, error) => [{ loading: false, error, data: null }],
  fetchData: (prevState) => [
    { ...prevState, loading: true },
    (actions) => effect(actions.setSuccess, actions.setError),
  ],
}
```
