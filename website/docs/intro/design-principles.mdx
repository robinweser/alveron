# Design Principles

## State is read-only

> This principle is inspired by [Redux](https://redux.js.org) and is basically a rewritten copy of their documentation.

State itself is read-only and can only be updated by invoking [actions](concepts/action).
Actions are so-called reducers. They take the previous state and a payload and reduce those to the next state.
Actions are the single source of truth in terms of state updates.

This ensures predictable state updates as our state can always only have a predefined shape.

> **Important Note**: Technically, it's impossible to enforce immutability on pure JavaScript objects. So it's more of a rule that requires discipline from it's users. If we want to be more safe, we can use a library such as [Immutable](https://immutable-js.com).

## Actions are pure functions

> Learn what a [pure function](concepts/action#pure-function) is.

As mentioned above, in order to update the state, we invoke actions.
Actions are pure reducer functions that return a new state based on the previous state and an optional payload.

> **Important Note**: Once again, we can't technically enforce pure functions in JavaScript, but it is highly recommended to follow this rule to avoid unexpected side effects.
> While we can't enforce pure reducers, it's highly recommended and for your own good.

## Effects must invoke actions to update state

Performing side effects, such as API calls, can be done using [effects](concepts/effect).
Effects are always triggered by invoking actions and in return invoke actions to update state.
They may invoke multiple actions, but must never mutate state directly, as our first principles applies here as well.

This again ensures predictable state at any given point of time.
