<Box
  padding={8}
  marginTop={8}
  marginBottom={-3}
  extend={{ border: '1px solid rgb(220, 220, 220)' }}>
  <Counter />
</Box>

```js
const model = 0

const actions = {
  reset: () => [model],
  increment: (state) => [state + 1],
  decrement: (state) => [state - 1],
  incrementBy: (state, increment) => [state + increment],
  decrementBy: (state, decrement) => [state - decrement],
  incrementIn: (state, delay) => [
    state,
    (actions) => setTimeout(actions.increment, delay),
  ],
}
```
